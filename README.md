# CVE-2024-10511

##### CWE-287: Improper Authentication

### Summary

Schneider Electric PowerChute Serial Shutdown product is a UPS management software enabling graceful system shutdown
and energy management capabilities for desktop, servers and workstations

PowerChute Serial Shutdown **v1.2.0.301 and prior** contains a mechanism to “lock out” for 2 minutes after three unsuccessful login attempts to prevent brute force password cracking. PowerChute allows only one account to be created and one login session active at a time.

An unauthenticated attacker can repeatedly perform HTTP GET request to the exposed URL that ends with */accessdenied* (which increments the number of login attempts), causing constant account lock out, therefore preventing legitimate user from logging in.


### Remediation

PowerChute Serial Shutdown version 1.3 includes a fix for this vulnerability and is available for download here:
